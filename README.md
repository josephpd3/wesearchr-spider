### Issues with Installation
I did have an issue with getting Scrapy to start a project correctly, and I don't know if this problem will present itself otherwise: [I encountered this runtime error with the `lxml` dependency, which seems to have stemmed from a version mismatch. The Stack Overflow comments should help you to resolve it as well.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23172384/lxml-runtime-error-reason-incompatible-library-version-etree-so-requires-vers)
